== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How do I set up the menu? =

Create 'menu' category. All menu sections go in here.(Name can be changed later, slug must be 'menu')

Specials -- A category named 'specials' must be set up. (Name can be changed later, slug must be 'specials'). Description acts as sub header for each menu item.

Items in specials will not show in the normal menu.

Menu sorting should be done by the 'Category Order and Taxonomy Terms Order', which provides a simple interface for organising the menu.




= How do I do menu item portion translations? =

When used with the qTranslate plugin, simply prepend any localised information with [:en] or [:de] in the 'Portion' box.

For example:

'[:en]One dozen [:de] Ein Dutzend'
