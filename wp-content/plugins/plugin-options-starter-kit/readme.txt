Starter kit to help create Plugin options pages, and learn how to put it all together. Contains all the commonly used form options.

== Description ==

*Update* Now includes examples of how to easily use the WordPress editor multiple times on your Plugin options pages! This is implemented via the new re-usable WordPress editor feature in WordPress 3.3.

Simple way to learn and set-up your Plugin options pages very quickly!

Use it to learn how to set-up Plugin options, or as a template to quickly create you own Plugins. There are lot's of code comments and sample usage of the Plugin options on the front end of your site.

Learn the proper way to use the powerful WordPress Settings API, and how to save all your Plugin options in a single options db entry (in an array). This is the recommended way to store your Plugin options as it cleaner and more efficient.

*The starter kit also includes*

* A useful 'Settings' link from the main Plugins page so that you can easily direct your Plugin users directly to your Plugin options page.
* A way to set-up default option settings when the Plugin is activated.
* A reset defaults Plugin option which you can use on all your Plugins which allows you to reset options opon Plugin deactivation/reactivation.
* A clean way to delete Plugin options if the Plugin is deactivated AND deleted.
* Uses sanitization methods (part of the Settings API) to cleanly validate textbox and textarea inputs.

All the starter kit code is properly indented to make it easier to read and follow the Plugin structure.

*Coming Soon*

Let me know if you have any suggestions to add to the list (or other starter kits you would love to see).

* Add developer version (without all the comments etc.) to create new Plugins from scratch even quicker!
* Examples of adding options to other WordPress admin pages too.
* Add Plugin localization.
* Extend the default settings callback function so that is allows for Plugin default options to be correctly set if they were added after the Plugin was FIRST activated.
